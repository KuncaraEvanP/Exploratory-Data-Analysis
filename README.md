# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the phase for a data analyst or data scientist diving into data to understand and seek business insight into the data.
There are several ways for a data scientist and analyst to get
insight and understand the data through Statistical Summary
of Columns, seeing the average of numeric and categorical data types
by understanding the median and mean for numeric data, the unique value
from the categorical column. Univariate Analysis, analyze each column
using various methods. Multivariate
Analysis, looking at the correlation of each column, generally a numeric column.
After that, we can make some business questions that can be asked
and answered by data so we don't dive too deep and acquire
useless information for the business.

## Objective
- Understanding how the values are distributed for each column
- Inspect the distribution form of column type
- Understanding the relationship between column pairs
- Answering Bussines questions

This phase is also the stage of preparing the data for data input into the machine learning model. If a skewed column has been found in this process, it can be followed up so that the shape of the column distribution is at least in normal form distribution.
